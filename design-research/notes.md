#Notes
- Roots in contructivism, cubism, futurism, neo-impressionism.
    + particularly the constructivist designs of the Bahaus
    + rooted in rationality, builiding blocks, elegant thought and architecture
    + grew to the psychedelic patterns now
- How it works
    + figure-ground relationship
    + puts the figure and ground in a tense and contradictory juxtaposition
    + 2 methods
        - black and white line patterns
        - color with contrast juxtaposition
            + color contrast creates depth
                * different types: simultaneous contrast, successive contrast, reverse contrast
                * simultaneous: one color surrounded by another, contrast
                * successive: one color viewed then another, only one direction, may be achieved by replacing one color viewed with another
                * reverse: lightness or darkness seems to spread
