##Op Art (Optical Art)
- A twentieth century style in which artists tried to create a feeling of movement in a picture using optical illusion.
- Gained momentum in the 1960s, but didn't last long when Warwhol led Pop Art movement.
- Stuck in graphic design, and designers use it for logos, book covers, etc. still.
- Op art in general seeks to create movement or a sense that the 2-dimensional picture is 3-dimensional.
    + sometimes, the movement works; objects swell, flow, etc.
    + other times, the patterns and shapes are made to look impossible or have two incompatible interpretations
- Uses Gestalt principle of **Multistability** (devil's tuning fork)
